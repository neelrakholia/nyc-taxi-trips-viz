# Visualization of 1.3 billion taxi trips in NYC

Inspired from Todd Schneider's blog post on the same topic: http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/. This plot basically recreates his analysis and updates it with more recent data. However, the tools used are slightly different. Todd primarily works with SQL. I created these plots using R, dbply, dplyr, and ggplot2.
